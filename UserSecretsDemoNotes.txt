  "SpecialValue":  "I am from USER secrets",


Hi I'm Sara!

Why/when you might need user secrets​
- Actual secrets that you need to run locally but shouldn't be committed - like Azure auth secret
- Can actually use to have any custom setting
  - Different db connection strings - eg if pointing at a backup db or docker instance or deployed service
  - Different api
  - You want to turn on a feature flag () but not commit it
- Can change temporarily in app settings but there is always a risk of accidentally committing it!
  - Also faff when changing branches

What is dotnet user secrets?​
- Effectively another appsettings file but based outside your git repo
- Only used in development mode
- It is correlated to your project by a guid
- Like appsettings, it is automatically included by the host builder but (like appsettings) you can also manually add it to a config builder
- You can access it through your IDE or direct through file explorer
  - %APPDATA%\Microsoft\UserSecrets\<user_secrets_id>\secrets.json
- BEWARE that it is linked to your windows user so if running things as admin then the secrets file will be in your admin user's appdata

- __bonus__ last loaded key wins, so default order of precedence is 
		1. appsettings.json file
		2. appsettings.{env.EnvironmentName}.json file
		3. The local User Secrets File #Only in local development environment
		4. Environment Variables
		5. Command Line Arguments


How to use​
- In Visual Studio​
  - Show application
  - Run without changes
  - Add config to appsettings development
  - Run again to show change
  - Add user secrets
  - Run again to show change
  - Show changes to csproj and explain that it is a one time thing
  
- In Rider​
  - Run to show it working
  - Show how to get to secrets
  - Modify it
  - Run to show it working
  
- With Notepad
      %APPDATA%\Microsoft\UserSecrets\
  - Mention the fact we're in user app data so if running as admin then will be in admin user folder

- On the command line
      dotnet user-secrets init --project UserSecrets
      dotnet user-secrets set "SpecialValue" "I've been set by the CLI" --project UserSecrets
	  dotnet user-secrets list --project UserSecrets
      dotnet user-secrets remove "SpecialValue" --project UserSecrets
	  
Any questions?
